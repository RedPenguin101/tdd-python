# chapter 5. saving user input and testing the database

1. a goal of TDD is to be 'deliberately short sighted' to allow yourself to handle one problem at a time
2. we could've jumped ahead to the solution, but we have gone step by step

## wiring up our form to send a POST request (4.3 -> 5.1)

1. to use a POST we need out element to have a `name` attribute and wrap it with a <form> tag
2. running your FT you will get a `noSuchElementException`. this is caused by Django's CSRF (cross site request forgery) protection. You need to put the `{% csrf_token %}` in your html
3. once done and run you will get a more familiar error saying the expected table row didn't appear.

## processing a POST request (4.3 -> 5.1)

1. we haven't specified an `action` attribute in our form, so it's not doing anything.
2. we want to change the `home_page` view/function so that it can deal with the POST. So we need to add a unit test.
3. in _lists/tests.pt_ add a `test_can_save_a_post_request` method. create a response with the `self.client.post` method. Then use the `response.content.decode` method to see if your expected output is in the html that's returned.
4. amend _lists/views.py_ to pass the test with a dummy value.
5. what we actually want is for our POST to be rendered on the page. again we use our jinja format to do this, putting `{{ new_item_text }}` in out table.
6. adjust the test to check whether it's still using the template. this will expected fail because of the dummy value, so we need to amend our view to return the template
7. change the view to a `render` function, which takes the request, the template, and as the third argument a dict with the stuff that should be populated in our template.
8. (this will actually fail because it breaks your render in the case there's no items. fix it with a `get` on the dict)
9. unit tests should now pass, but func test doesn't. improve your error message so you can see what the text in the row actually says, using the awesome new 3.6 fstring syntax. `f"new item didn't appear in table. Contents were:\n{table.text}"`
10. or even better, get rid of the shitty `any` stuff and use and `assertIn`, which does the verbose output for you.

### how to get rid of 'cheat' code without breaking the cycle

11. the problem is our test expects a '1:' at the start. we can 'cheat' and hardcode this into our code, to make it pass the test. this is totally fine (in fact required) under proper TDD.
12. When do you get rid of the cheat code?
13. You either do it during a refactor, or you write additional tests which would catch this. for example here we'd test adding a second item and check whether it returns 2.
