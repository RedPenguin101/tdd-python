# Chapter 6: Improving functional tests: ensuring isolations and removing voodoo sleeps

## housekeeping (5.11 -> 6.1)

1. before we continue we want to automate the cleanup after ft runs and remove time.sleeps
2. the first is us saying we want _isolation_ between tests, i.e. one run of tests shouldn't affect another.
3. right now our FTs run against the prod database. which is obviosusly bad.
4. Django offers a solution: a `LiveServerTestCase`, which spins up a test DB
5. make a folder for you functional tests and stick your FT in it (using git mv). also creathe init file.
6. change your ft to make it use a test server by importing it and making your test inherit from it.
7. when referring to the url, use `self.live_server_url`
8. remove main, since we'll use `python manage.py test functional_tests` going forward
9. run the FTs a couple of times to check that it's doing it properly
