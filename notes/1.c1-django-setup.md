# Part 1: basics
1. functional testing vs. unit testing
2. tdd workflow (test/code cycle)
3. git and when to commit
4. testing goat

# Chaper 1: getting django set up using a functional test

## The testing goat - do nothing until you have a test

1. the unofficial mascot of python TDD
2. the voice in your head that keeps you on the true path of testing
3. bleating: test first, test first.
4. first, write a test. then run the test and check that it fils. then build some of your app.

## Functional tests
1. create your functional test to check that Django is installed, by spinning it up andhit it with a selenium request.

```py
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Firefox()
browser.get('http://localhost:8000')

assert 'Django' in browser.title
```
2. now we have a failing test, the goat will let us start building

## create your Django project
`django-admin.py startproject superlists .`

1. creates a _manage.py_ file and folder structure
2. _manage.py_ is the key. `python manage.py runserver`
3. with a running server your test should pass

## git
1. create a git repo if you haven't already
2. you want your sqlite db, your geckolog and venv in git ignore - `echo "db.sqlite3" Â» .gitignore` etc.
