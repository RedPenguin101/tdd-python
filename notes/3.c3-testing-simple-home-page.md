# chapter 3 testing a simple homepage with unit tests

## django app and unit test
1. in django you put code in _apps_. one project has many apps.
`python manage.py startapp lists`

2. FTs test from the outside, from view of the user, UTs from inside, view of the programmer.
3. approach here is:
	a. start with a FT describing the new functionality
	b. write unit test to define behavior of code
	c. write application code, and do the loop a few times
	d. run your FT - you might move on or decide to do more unit tests
4. idea is FTs drive high level, give right functionality, UTs drive low level, give clean code
6. create _lists/tests.py_

```python
from django.test import TestCase

class SmokeTest(TestCase):
	def test_bad_maths(self):
		self.assertEqual(1+1, 3)
```

call the django test with `python manage.py test`
