# Chapter 4. what are we doing with all these tests? and, refactoring

1. excessive? redundency between unit and functional? testing Django not app? trivial tests? `home_page=None` is stupid? do you actually code like this?
2. Programming is hard, tdd is there for when we are not smart. small increments stop us getting tired and lazy. a _discipline_. it doesn't come naturally.
3. testing the trivial? it's a kata, you practice it in unadverse times, so when adverse times come, even if they sneak up on you, you don't have to think about changing your behavior at a difficult time (adverse times here is when complexity arises). it's also a simple rule. when is the right time to write tests? always.

## back to testing user interactions
1. we were at the point where our functional test was passing 
2. code in stuff for your other functional tests
