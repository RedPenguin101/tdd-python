# Chapter 7: working incrementally

## (6.2 -> 7.1)

### incremental design

1. right now we have one global list - obviously this is a problem
2. this chapter focuses on adapt existing code incrementally, to get from working state to working state.
3. right now our FT says something to the effect of 'Edith sees that the site has generated a unique URL for her which remembers her list'
4. what we _actually_ want is for different users to not see eachothers lists, and get their own URL. how could we do that?
5. we don't want big design up front, but thinking about design isn't banned. 
6. our MVP here is:
	a. each user can store their own list - one for now
	b. a list has several items
	c. we eed to save lists from one visit to the next - via a URL for now.
7. it sounds like we will need to store lists with their items, and give each list a URL
8. STOP THINKING ABOUT DESIGN NOW. YAGNI (you ain't gonna need it)

### REST(ish)

1. how should the user get the URL? Let's follow rest and have something like `/lists/<list identifier>` for a get, `lists/new` for a new list POST, and `lists/<list identifier>/add_item` for a new item on an existing list POST
2. our scratchpad looks like:
	a. adjust model so items are associated with different lists
	b. add unique URLs for each list
	c. add URL for creating new list via post
	d. add URL for adding a new item to an existing list via POST
3. to do this in a TDD way, we need to add a functional test, write minimal code (via unit tests)

### Regression tests

1. add a new functional test which introduces a 2nd user, gets them adding an item, and test that they get a different URL than the first one, and also don't get the first person's items.
